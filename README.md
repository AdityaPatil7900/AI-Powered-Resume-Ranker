## ✨ Features
- 📥 Upload multiple resumes (PDF format)
- 📝 Enter any job description
- 🤖 Leverages TF-IDF and cosine similarity and TF-IDF + cosine
- 📊 Ranks resumes by relevance
- 💬 Clean, interactive UI with Streamlit
- 🎯 Ideal for portfolio projects, HR tech tools, and interview screening automation

## 🧠 How It Works
1. **Job description** is embedded using a BERT model.
2. **Each resume** is parsed and embedded the same way.
3. **Cosine similarity** is computed between job description and each resume.
4. Results are **ranked from highest to lowest** match.
